This repository contains ROS2 packages developed for robot simulation and control course at Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology of Warsaw University of Technology.

The course was split into two blocks:
- manipulation block (C++, MoveIt)
- navigation block (Python, Nav2)

All the work was done on the PAL Robotics TIAGo robot simulated in the Gazebo Classic environment.
